    title: "Milestone 2 - Elaboration"
    description: |
      The elaboration phase builds upon the foundation established in inception. Here we dive deep into 
      system architecture, refine our requirements, and create detailed development plans that will 
      guide the construction phase.

      ## Key Objectives
      - Design system architecture
      - Refine and detail requirements
      - Identify and mitigate major risks
      - Create development methodology
      - Establish coding standards and guidelines

      ## Deliverables
      - System architecture document
      - Detailed requirements specification
      - Database design and data models
      - User interface mockups and wireframes
      - Development plan and sprint structure

      ## Timeline
      This phase spans 4-6 weeks and ensures we have a solid technical foundation before beginning construction.
