    description: |
      The construction phase is where our vision becomes reality. This is the core development period where 
      we implement features, build the system, and conduct iterative testing to ensure quality and functionality.

      ## Key Objectives
      - Implement core system features
      - Develop user interfaces and experiences
      - Conduct continuous integration and testing
      - Perform iterative development cycles
      - Build and refine system components

      ## Deliverables
      - Working software system
      - Implemented core features
      - User interface components
      - Test suites and automated testing
      - Integration documentation

      ## Timeline
      This is the longest phase, typically spanning 8-12 weeks of intensive development and testing cycles.
