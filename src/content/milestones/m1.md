      ## Contex
      [AETTUA](https://www.aettua.pt) is an active non-profit association associated with [DETI](https://www.ua.pt/pt/deti), University of Aveiro that needs to manage a wide range of activities, resources, and members.
      
      ## Problem
      Currently, much of the AETTUA's management process relies on scattered tools and manual work, making it harder to ensure efficiency, transparency, and integration across departments.

      ## Goals
      + Develop a functional prototype of an ERP adapted to AETTUAâ€™s workflows.
      + Centralize core processes such as membership management, event organization, and financial control.
      + Improve communication and collaboration between different teams inside AETTUA.
      + Ensure data security, transparency, and accessibility.
      + Provide a scalable foundation for future iterations of the ERP, with potential to integrate more advanced modules.

      ## Tasks
      + Member Management: registration, updates, and tracking of members.
      + Financial Management: control of revenues, expenses, and financial reports.
      + Resource Management: inventory of materials, rooms, and equipment.
      + Dashboard & Indicators: quick visualization of key metrics (active members, events held, financial status, etc.)

      ## Expected Results
      + Member Management: registration, updates, and tracking of members.
      + Financial Management: control of revenues, expenses, and financial reports.
      + Resource Management: inventory of materials, rooms, and equipment.
      + Dashboard & Indicators: quick visualization of key metrics (active members, events held, financial status, etc.).
