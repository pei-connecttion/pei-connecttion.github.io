      # Goal
      **Develop a system to manage and optimize associationsâ€™ workflows**

      ## Context
      [AETTUA](https://www.aettua.pt) is an active non-profit association affiliated with [DETI](https://www.ua.pt/pt/deti), University of Aveiro, that manages a wide range of student activities, events, and resources.

      Currently, AETTUA relies on scattered tools (such as Excel spreadsheets) and manual processes to manage its operations, which are rudimentary and inefficient. This fragmented approach creates significant operational challenges that hinder the association's effectiveness.

      ## Problem Statement
      The current management processes at AETTUA suffer from several critical issues that impact operational efficiency:

      **Core Problems Identified:**
      + **Lack of Centralized Oversight** - No unified system to monitor all association activities
      + **Limited Scalability and Data Accessibility** - Information scattered across multiple platforms
      + **Inefficient Communication and Coordination** - Poor integration between different teams
      + **Fragmented Information Management** - Critical data stored in isolated systems

      **Specific Operational Challenges:**
      + **No Inventory Management** - Inability to track materials, equipment, and room availability
      + **Rudimentary Financial Processes** - Manual, fragmented invoicing requiring multiple Excel files and external systems
      + **Inadequate Member Management** - Difficulty tracking membership status, fees, and member information

      ## Expected Results
      The implementation of connecTTion will deliver the following outcomes:

      + **Centralized Inventory Management** - Controlled tracking and real-time stock updates for all association resources
      + **Enhanced Financial Control** - Automated invoice generation and comprehensive budget management
      + **Improved Team Collaboration** - Streamlined communication and coordination between different departments
      + **Automated Reporting** - Automatic generation of inventory and financial reports
      + **Scalable Foundation** - Modular architecture enabling future system expansion and integration of additional modules

      ## System Actors
      The system will serve three primary user types:

      **Management Board** - Complete oversight and control of all information with decision-making capabilities based on comprehensive data analysis

      **Department Heads** - Management of respective resources and activities within their areas of responsibility

      **Association Members** - Basic access to personal data with additional functionality permissions granted by management

      ## User Stories & Epic Modules

      **Member Management Module**
      - Members can check membership fee status and update personal information
      - Management maintains centralized and up-to-date member information

      **Inventory Management System**
      - Comprehensive organization of all physical association resources
      - Real-time tracking of quantities and locations

      **Financial Management Module**
      - Automation of time-consuming processes like invoice generation
      - Streamlined report generation for efficient and intuitive financial management

      ## State of the Art Analysis
      ![State of the Art Comparison](/images/milestones/m1/sota.png)

      Our analysis compared connecTTion with leading solutions including SAP, Dynamics 365, NetSuite, and Sage. Our primary competitive advantage lies in combining comprehensive member management with significantly lower costs than existing enterprise solutions.

      ## System Architecture
      ![System Architecture](/images/milestones/m1/arch.png)

      We've adopted a plugin-based architecture to ensure scalability beyond our AETTUA case study, enabling expansion to various types of associations through new plugin implementations.

      **Core System Components:**
      + **Dashboard** - Centralized visualization of plugin data (active members, events, financial status)
      + **Access Control & Roles** - Permission and access management based on user roles
      + **Logging & Audit System** - Complete activity tracking and registration
      + **Data Management** - Database administration and management
      + **Plugin Management** - Configuration and control of functional modules

      **Planned Plugin Modules:**
      + **Inventory Management** - Material and equipment organization
      + **Event Management** - AETTUA event coordination and planning
      + **Financial Management** - Automated invoicing and budget processes
      + **Member Management** - Member registration and information updates
      + **Customer Relationship Management** - Partnership and communication management
      + **Report Export/Import** - Detailed report generation and data exchange
